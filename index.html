      <p class="kindergarten-text">It all started with Shirakawa Elementary.
        For 6-7 years we didn't talk to each other and we hung out in our own separate groups (even though
        we were all in one giant group anyways since our class had only 90 kids). We only had mutual friends
        and knew nothing about each other. But for the last few months
        of middle school, we started getting to know each other via Jenna.
        Eventually the two of us started going on walks after school around the basketball courts and this was when our friendship started to blossom.</p>

            Had we attended different high schools, our friendship would have ended here for sure. But luckily
            we both started high school at Andrew Hill. On the first few days we hung out with the remaining
            Shirakawa kids, but over time each of us us split into new groups. You and I stayed in the same one, we ate lunch
            together every day, and even had a couple classes together. Having PE together
            brought us really close because we had a lot of downtime since the gym was under construction.
            People came and went in our friend group, but our bond kept growing stronger! We did a bunch of
            things together: we performed for three Fantastics Events, went to Prom, and even bussed to Los Angeles for a K-Pop Festival!
            (lmao at the fact that we stood in line under the sun for 2 hours to get lemonade and kimbap)</p>

              After High School we both attended San Jose State University (feels weird to write in past tense
              because we JUST graduated). Even after four years spent together in high school,
              we continued learning about each other and getting closer.

            <p class="kindergarten-text"> There were semesters where we spent a bunch of time together
        and others where we did our own thing. But what I love most about our friendship
       is that no matter where we were or what we were doing, we still ended up making
       the same inside jokes and saying dumb shit when we hung out. Thank you for being my Best Friend for all these years.</p>
